## Materials

During this workshop we'll be looking at how public data published by NYPD undermines the police's own narratives about themselves. Before we meet, you may want to take a quick look at the following datasets, some of which we'll be discussing in class:

* [NYPD Compaint Data (Historic)](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/NYPD-Complaint-Data-Historic/qgea-i56i) (these are crimes reported, not complaints against the police)
* [NYPD Complaint Data Current (Year To Date)](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/NYPD-Complaint-Data-Current-Year-To-Date-/5uac-w243)
* [NYPD Arrests Data (Historic)](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/NYPD-Arrests-Data-Historic-/8h9b-rp9u)
* [NYPD Arrest Data (Year to Date)](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/NYPD-Arrest-Data-Year-to-Date-/uip8-fykc)
* [NYPD Criminal Court Summons (Historic)](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/NYPD-Criminal-Court-Summons-Historic-/sv2w-rv3k)
* [NYPD Criminal Court Summons Incident Level Data (Year To Date)](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/NYPD-Criminal-Court-Summons-Incident-Level-Data-Ye/mv4k-y93f)
* [Civilian Complaint Review Board (CCRB) - Complaints Received](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Civilian-Complaint-Review-Board-CCRB-Complaints-Re/63nx-cpi9)
* [Citywide Payroll Data (Fiscal Year)](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/City-Government/Citywide-Payroll-Data-Fiscal-Year-/k397-673e)

Each of these should have a `View Data` button that allows you to see the full dataset, as well as a data dictionary that explains the meaning of each column.
